Initialization
--------------

You need a postgres database.
You have to change the variable sqlalchemy.url in alembic.ini
If your database is new, you have to run:
    PYTHONPATH=../ alembic upgrade head
Otherwise, you need to initialize once alembic on your database with:
    PYTHONPATH=../ alembic stamp head

Change the model
----------------

You have to change files in models directory. When you're happy with yourself
you can make a revision with:
    PYTHONPATH=../ alembic revision --autogenerate -m "My message"
It will create a revision with the changes you made in models. You have to check
the autogenerated file in alembic/versions, and adapt it. And of course you need
to add it to git.

Add a function
--------------

You have to make a revision with:
    PYTHONPATH=../ alembic revision -m "My message"
and change the produced file in alembic/versions, and add it to git
